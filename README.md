# Kickstarter-Parser
Basically this tool is supposed to watch a pledge of your choice on (hopefully) any kickstarter project page. It will inform you about any occurring changes on your watched pledge. You can use this tool to watch, for example, a pledge that is "out of stock".



It's self-explaining, you cannot watch multiple pledges at once, yet.
