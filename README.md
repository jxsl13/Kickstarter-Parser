# Kickstarter-Parser
Basically this tool is supposed to watch a pledge of your choice on (hopefully) any kickstarter project page. It will inform you about any occurring changes on your watched pledge. You can use this tool to watch, for example, a pledge that is "out of stock".

# Features
- Watches one Kickstarter Project
- Watches multiple pledge options(should be out of stock) of that one kickstarter project 
- Opens the "change pledge" website of your watched project in your default web browser, when one of your watched pledges' available quantity changes



It's self-explaining, you can watch multiple pledges of one project at once. The application will terminate itself if changes occur on one of your watched pledges.
